# Project Approach

This project focuses on reliable text extraction from PDFs and scanned images, then offering lightweight, actionable engagement suggestions. I built a small React (Vite + TypeScript) frontend with a drag-and-drop uploader, clear loading states, and friendly errors. The backend is a minimal Node.js/Express service that accepts uploads and routes them to specialized extractors: pdf-parse (and a pdf.js fallback) for PDFs, and Tesseract for OCR on image files. Extracted text is normalized (preserving paragraph breaks and headings where possible) and returned with basic statistics (characters, words) plus fast heuristics for engagement: length checks, hashtag counts, CTA detection, readability hints, and formatting warnings.

The architecture prioritizes simplicity and reliability over complex features. PDF extraction uses a primary method with automatic fallback, while OCR leverages Tesseract's proven accuracy. Text analysis focuses on practical, implementable suggestions rather than complex AI analysis. The monorepo structure keeps frontend and backend tightly coupled during development while enabling independent deployment. Performance considerations include lazy-loading Tesseract workers and memory-efficient file processing. The system handles edge cases gracefully with clear error messages and retry mechanisms.
